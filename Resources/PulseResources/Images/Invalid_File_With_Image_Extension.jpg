Real Stories, Real Results
Osmos offered ready-made reports and the ability to broadcast ads with a single click from a self-serve platform to optimise Purplle and its advertisers’ bandwidth. Osmos offered automation for scheduled reporting, budget tracking, and AI-powered estimates of key metrics and budget recommendations for every type of campaign.

Purplle
Online Beauty Retailer
We seamlessly integrated and launched the platform in less than a month. The platform is scalable, reliable and lightning-fast, processing 100s of millions of ad requests. I highly recommend OnlineSales.ai to any business looking for a reliable and effective solution for their retail media needs.

Sellers are now also able to generate detailed reports that provide them critical insights into campaigns, and help them make better use of their budgets - enhancing their experience and interest in advertising on the platform. The differential UX offered by Monetize helped Tata 1mg engage brands of all levels in technical aptitude to use the platform easily.
